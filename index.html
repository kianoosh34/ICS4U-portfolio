		<h2 id='post1'>1. Making the Portfolio</h2>

<p>Working on the making the portfolio was pretty interesting. First, I wanted a clean design that wasn't hard to make but was still visually pleasing, so I used my knowledge on HTML and CSS to make a simple site layout, with a heading, a table, and many CSS properties. There was something I needed to do with the tabs though, so I made a script that edited the CSS with the DOM code I had learned. Some parts of the site I learned to make on my own, such as getting paramaters in the URL, and flex boxes, which both were great improvements to my portfolio.</p>

<h2 id='post2'>2. Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h2>

<p>I made a lot of great projects in natural simulations. It's one of the parts of the class I felt I could actually take and carry into the future. The physics simulation and all the object tricks are pretty important and useful. Working with the code editor was very confusing at times, though. Many times, challenges would not complete and the program doesn't give any indication to why.</p>

<h2 id='post3'>3. Coding Challenges (Presentation)</h2>

<p>Clocks are pretty simple, so stuff like emerging technologies aren't really something we could have really done. Also, the math concept was angles. We tried our best. We didn't get a lot of submissions for spinoffs. I feel like my personal additions were pretty good, and that the lesson was well done. Still waiting to see the comments on my presentation.</p>

<h2 id='post4'>4. Coding Challenges (Spinoffs)</h2>

<p>I put it on myself to make a spinoff for every coding challenge, and I did just that. The changes I made to each were pretty good and significant, as well. They were all pretty interesting to do and I mostly enjoyed them. It also helped me get used to javascript outside of Khanacademy's wierd limitations.</p>

<h2 id='post5'>5. Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</h2>

<p>Javascript is a language with wierd rules, but it's pretty useful. At least now I know how to read javascript code in general, and that will come in handy pretty often.</p>

<h2 id='post6'>6. HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive</h2>

<p>Useful for so much things that I saw websites do but didn't know how to do myself. Came in handy when creating this portfolio. Sometimes it got confusing, though.</p>

<h2 id='post7'>7. HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive with jQuery</h2>

<p>A more complex but also somehow simpler version of the regular DOM. Useful, but I haven't used it all that much.</p>

<h2 id='post8'>8. Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages</h2>

<p>I knew some of this stuff, but it was a good refresher. There really is lots of stuff I gotta memorize, though. Once you know how to start, you can make so much things, and some may even look presentable!</p>

<h2 id='post9'>9. Algorithms</h2>

<p>Algorithms was pretty confusing, and not a lot of it was interesting, either. I'm gonna have to go back on it at some point. The "path to goal" stuff was pretty good, though.</p>

<h2 id='post10'>10. Github</h2>

<p>Everytime I learn to use git commands and all that, I forget how it works and have to relearn it again because I don't use it at all. How do I escape this cycle!?</p>
